# Project Description
This project explores the fundamentals of React, focusing on the concept of "state". You'll learn to display elements, use JSX, handle events, and update the UI dynamically. The module culminates in building a simple counter application. By the end, you'll understand how to use state to create interactive web applications.

Additionally, you'll implement two buttons that, when clicked, change the text displayed above them to match the name of the clicked button.

# Learning Objectives
- Understand the basics of React.
- Learn JSX syntax and its usage.
- Handle events and state in React.
- Build and update dynamic user interfaces.
- Create a simple counter application to apply learned concepts.
- Implement buttons that change displayed text dynamically.

# Task: Implementing Buttons
As part of this project, i'll add two buttons. When either button is clicked, the text displayed above the buttons will update to show the name of the clicked button. This task will help you practice handling state and events in React.
